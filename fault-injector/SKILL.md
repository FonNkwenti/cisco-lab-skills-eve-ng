# Fault Injector Skill

Generates Python scripts that inject the troubleshooting scenarios defined in lab workbooks into the live lab environment. Enables students to set up fault conditions for exam-style troubleshooting practice without manual configuration.

-# Instructions

--# Step 1: Parse Inputs

Read from the lab directory:
1. `workbook.md` — extract troubleshooting scenarios from Section 9
2. From each scenario extract: **Scenario Number**, **Target Device**, **Fault Type**, **Commands to inject**

**Port discovery at runtime:** Console ports are NOT hardcoded in the scripts. Each script calls
`find_open_lab(host, node_names=[DEVICE_NAME])` to auto-discover which lab is currently running,
then passes the result to `discover_ports(host, lab_path)` for the `{node_name: port}` map.
The optional `--lab-path` argument lets users override auto-discovery when needed. Scripts must
NEVER hardcode a `DEFAULT_LAB_PATH` — lab paths vary across EVE-NG instances and .unl filenames.

--# Step 2: Generate Fault Injection Scripts

For each scenario (minimum 3 per lab), generate `scripts/fault-injection/inject_scenario_0N.py`.

Use `assets/inject_scenario_01_template.py` (and `_02`, `_03`) as base templates. Customise:
- `DEVICE_NAME` — target device name (must match the node name in the EVE-NG lab)
- `FAULT_COMMANDS` list — from the scenario's solution section (the inverse of the fix)
- `PREFLIGHT_CMD` — `show` command whose output verifies pre-injection state
- `PREFLIGHT_SOLUTION_MARKER` — string present only in the known-good config
- `PREFLIGHT_FAULT_MARKER` — string present only after the fault is already injected
- Docstring describing exactly what fault is injected

Each script must:
1. Call `require_host(args.host)` to validate the `--host` argument (exits with code 2 if placeholder)
2. Call `find_open_lab(host, node_names=[DEVICE_NAME])` to auto-discover the running lab path
3. Call `discover_ports(host, lab_path)` to get the `{node_name: port}` map via EVE-NG REST API
4. Call `connect_node(host, port)` to open a Netmiko telnet session to the console port
5. Run `preflight(conn)` to verify the lab is in the known-good state before injecting
6. Apply fault commands via `conn.send_config_set(FAULT_COMMANDS)`
7. Save with `conn.save_config()` and always `conn.disconnect()` in a `finally` block

**Never define `DEFAULT_LAB_PATH`.** Lab paths vary across EVE-NG instances. Auto-discovery
via `find_open_lab()` is required; `--lab-path` is an optional manual override only.

Exit codes: `0` success, `3` EVE-NG error, `4` pre-flight check failed.

--# Step 3: Generate apply_solution.py

Use `assets/apply_solution_template.py` as the base template. Customise:
- `RESTORE_TARGETS` — list of all device names affected by any of the scenarios

The script reads solution configs from `solutions/[Device].cfg` (two directory levels above
`scripts/fault-injection/`, i.e. the lab root). It calls `find_open_lab(host, node_names=RESTORE_TARGETS)`
to auto-discover the lab, then `discover_ports()` for port lookup. Supports `--reset` to run
`erase_device_config()` before pushing configs. Do NOT define `DEFAULT_LAB_PATH`.

--# Step 4: Generate scripts/fault-injection/README.md

Use `assets/README_template.md` as the base. Fill in:
- One section per scenario: scenario number, target device, command to run
- **Ops-only — do NOT include fault names or descriptions that reveal what is broken**
- Usage instructions for injecting and restoring
- Prerequisites (EVE-NG lab running with all nodes started, netmiko installed)

--# Step 5: Validate

- [ ] One inject script per scenario
- [ ] `apply_solution.py` restores all affected devices
- [ ] `README.md` lists all available scenarios
- [ ] All scripts are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- [ ] NO `DEFAULT_LAB_PATH` constant in any script — auto-discovery via `find_open_lab()` is used
- [ ] `find_open_lab` is imported from `eve_ng` in all scripts
- [ ] `--lab-path` defaults to `None` and is treated as optional override only
- [ ] `RESTORE_TARGETS` in `apply_solution.py` covers every device touched by any scenario
- [ ] `PREFLIGHT_SOLUTION_MARKER` and `PREFLIGHT_FAULT_MARKER` are distinct, unambiguous strings
- [ ] Syntax-check every generated `.py` file WITHOUT creating cache files. Use one of:
  - `python3 -c "import ast, sys; [ast.parse(open(f).read(), f) for f in sys.argv[1:]]" inject_scenario_01.py ...`  (preferred — no filesystem side effects)
  - OR `python3 -m py_compile *.py && rm -rf __pycache__ scripts/fault-injection/__pycache__`  (acceptable — but MUST include the rm)
  Fix any SyntaxError before proceeding. Never leave `__pycache__/` directories in the lab package.

--# Step 6: Report generated files (do NOT write meta.yaml)

The fault-injector skill MUST NOT write or modify `meta.yaml`. Provenance is
owned by the caller:

- **When dispatched by lab-assembler (default):** Return the list of generated
  files in your Output Confirmation. The parent `lab-assembler` run will fold
  those paths into `meta.yaml.created.files` using the parent agent's
  provenance. Do not touch meta.yaml.

- **When invoked standalone on a pre-existing lab (rare):** The invoking user
  or orchestrator is responsible for running `/tag-lab <lab-path>` after this
  skill completes. `/tag-lab` stamps the correct provenance and appends an
  `updated[]` entry with the real agent ID. Do not auto-write meta.yaml.

This rule prevents "subagent bleed" where the fault-injector's own identity
(`agent: claude-sonnet-4-6` or `agent: unknown`) overwrites the parent's
provenance record.

-# Common Issues

--# workbook.md has no troubleshooting scenarios
- **Cause:** The workbook was generated without a Section 9, or scenarios were not written.
- **Solution:** Stop. Ask the user to add at least 3 troubleshooting scenarios to `workbook.md` Section 9 before running this skill. Use `assets/troubleshooting_scenarios_template.md` (from the `lab-assembler` assets) as a reference format.

--# EVE-NG port discovery fails (EveNgError)
- **Cause:** Lab is not running, the `.unl` file hasn't been imported yet, or `--host` is wrong.
- **Solution:** Ensure the lab is imported into EVE-NG and all nodes are started. Verify `--host` is the EVE-NG server IP, and `--lab-path` matches the path shown in the EVE-NG web UI (e.g. `ospf/lab-00-single-area-ospfv2.unl`).

--# Scenario fault commands are unclear
- **Cause:** The solution section in the workbook doesn't clearly show what was misconfigured.
- **Solution:** Derive the fault as the inverse of the solution: if the solution says `ip ospf hello-interval 10`, the fault is `ip ospf hello-interval 30`.

--# apply_solution.py restores wrong state
- **Cause:** `solutions/` configs were updated after the fault scripts were generated.
- **Solution:** Regenerate `apply_solution.py` after any workbook or solutions update.

-# Examples

User: "Generate fault injection scripts for EIGRP Lab 03."

Actions:
1. Read `labs/eigrp/lab-03-[name]/workbook.md` — extract 3 troubleshooting scenarios (target device, fault type, commands).
2. For each scenario, generate an `inject_scenario_0N.py` using the template from `assets/` — using `find_open_lab()` for lab discovery, NOT a hardcoded `DEFAULT_LAB_PATH`.
3. Generate `apply_solution.py` with `RESTORE_TARGETS` covering all affected devices.
4. Generate `scripts/fault-injection/README.md` with `--host <eve-ng-ip>` in all commands.
5. Report generated files to the caller per Step 6 — DO NOT write `meta.yaml`.
