Topology diagrams ship as `.drawio` source only. Open them in the draw.io
desktop app or app.diagrams.net to view; no rendered image is committed.

This file is kept as a no-op stub so any lingering scripts or CI steps that
still invoke it exit cleanly with this message instead of failing obscurely.
